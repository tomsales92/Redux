First step you install the json server using the following command:
npm install -g json-server
Then, you can run the command and select the port using the following command:
npx json-server --watch -p 3333 server.json
Change 3333 to the port number you want and replace server.json with the name of your fake api.

In my case, I'm using React js and my server.json is at the root of my application.
